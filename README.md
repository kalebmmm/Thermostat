# Thermostat
Using a Raspberry PI and a temperature/moisture sensor, we can control a TP-Link Kasa smart plug with a space heater. 
Additionally, the software on the PI pings the bluetooth address of a configured phone to determine if someone is home. 
This project uses NodeJS, Python, and HTML/CSS.
